    abstract = "{Access-based consumption, defined as transactions that can be market mediated but where no transfer of ownership takes place, is becoming increasingly popular, yet it is not well theorized. This study examines the nature of access as it contrasts to ownership and sharing, specifically the consumer-object, consumer-consumer, and consumer-marketer relationships. Six dimensions are identified to distinguish among the range of access-based consumptionscapes: temporality, anonymity, market mediation, consumer involvement, the type of accessed object, and political consumerism. Access-based consumption is examined in the context of car sharing via an interpretive study of Zipcar consumers. Four outcomes of these dimensions in the context of car sharing are identified: lack of identification, varying significance of use and sign value, negative reciprocity resulting in a big-brother model of governance, and a deterrence of brand community. The implications of our findings for understanding the nature of exchange, consumption, and brand community are discussed.}",

    abstract = { One year into a carsharing program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, compelling evidence of reduced vehicle ownership, reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and social change was uncovered through member surveys and detailed usage data. Each PhillyCarShare vehicle replaced an average of 23 private vehicles. Members giving up cars overwhelmingly reported driving less and replacing automobile trips with a variety of modes (transit, walking, taxi, and to a lesser extent biking). However, members who simply gained access to cars used PhillyCarShare primarily to substitute for modes that most resemble driving (taxis, borrowing or renting, and to a lesser extent transit). The average monthly VMT increase of members gaining access to a car was limited to 29.9 mi, whereas the monthly VMT decrease of members who gave up a car appeared to be several hundred miles but not greater than 522 mi. After joining, PhillyCarShare members made travel decisions more judiciously, expressed greater awareness of transportation costs, and valued environmental friendliness far more than previously. Members also preferred residential locations near PhillyCarShare locations. Motivation for joining varied greatly by income, eventual change in car ownership, and age. Convenience was valued highly by all groups, especially former car owners. Affordability was usually second most important. Comparison with other U.S. carsharing organizations revealed advanced education to be the strongest demographic of membership, followed by nonauto commuting and living in small or nontraditional households. In contrast to Europe's early members, American first adopters appeared more concerned with personal utility than social or environmental benefits; they were motivated more by convenience and less by affordability, possibly because of much lower costs of driving in the United States. }

Current high importance of urban sustainability, considering its constantly evolving, associated with a growing environmental awareness of the population, results on the need to reevaluate the current management systems for sustainability of urban centers, trying to give them a larger organization and efficiency, associated with a low socio-economic impact. Different sustainability assessment methodologies were analysed and it was concluded that have to be complemented to have a more balanced distribution of its indicators among the different sustainability dimensions. Based on literature review, four sustainable dimensions were considered in this study: environmental, social, economic and cultural that includes specific indicators for urban mobility. A new proposal of an indicators system for urban sustainability assessment was proposed. A balanced distribution of the indicators within the four dimensions and a more flexible and suitable indicators were obtained.}

    abstract = { Shared-use vehicle services provide members with access to a vehicle fleet for use as needed, without the hassles and costs of individual automobile ownership. From June 2001 to July 2002, there was a survey of 18 U.S. shared-use vehicle organizations on a range of topics, including organizational size, partnerships, pricing, costs, and technology. Although survey findings demonstrate a decline in the number of organizational starts in the last year, operational launches into new cities, membership, and fleet size continue to increase. Several growth-oriented organizations are responsible for most of this expansion. Several factors were explored that challenge shared-use vehicle growth, such as high capital investment (or start-up costs), dramatic insurance rate hikes, and scarcity of cost-effective technologies. Although the findings of early niche markets are encouraging, the ability of this emerging sector to actualize its total environmental, economic, and social goals may be limited without the collective support of private industry (e.g., automobile manufacturers, insurance providers, technology producers); public agents (e.g., transit and governmental agencies); and shared-use vehicle programs. Indeed, publicâ€“private partnerships and cooperation among shared-use vehicle providers may play a key role in addressing insurance and technology costs and ensuring the long-term viability of this market. }

    abstract = { Carsharing (or short-term auto use) provides a flexible alternative that meets diverse transportation needs across the globe while reducing the negative impacts of private vehicle ownership. Although carsharing appeared in Europe between the 1940s and 1980s, the concept did not become popularized until the early 1990s. For nearly 20 years, worldwide participation in carsharing has been growing. Today, carsharing operates in approximately 600 cities around the world, in 18 nations and on 4 continents. Approximately 348,000 individuals share nearly 11,700 vehicles as part of organized carsharing services (>60\% in Europe). Malaysia is operating a carsharing pilot, with a planned launch in 2007. Another eight countries are exploring carsharing. Thirty-three carsharing expert surveys were identified on an international basis. Cost savings, convenient locations, and guaranteed parking were identified as the most common motivations for carsharing use worldwide. An international comparison of carsharing operations, including similarities and differences, is provided. Continued growth is forecast, particularly among new and emerging market segments, such as businesses and universities. Growth-oriented operators will continue to account for the largest number of members and fleets deployed worldwide. In addition, high energy costs; limited and expensive parking; ongoing diffusion of operational knowledge, benefits, and supportive technologies; and increased demand for personal vehicle access in developing nations will affect carsharing's growth and expansion. }

    abstract = { Carsharing offers innovative mobility solutions and has been gaining popularity around the world as an environmentally sustainable, socially responsible, and economically feasible form of mobility. Carsharing allows members to benefit from private vehicle use without the costs and responsibilities of ownership and provides individuals with access to a fleet of shared-use vehicles in a network of locations on a short-term, as-needed basis. This paper seeks to develop a stochastic optimization framework to address the dynamic vehicle allocation problem for carsharing systems, in which the service operator needs to manage and determine the optimal vehicle allocation in both time and space to maximize profits. A multistage stochastic linear programming model with recourse, which can account for system uncertainties such as car-sharing demand variation, is formulated and solved. Numerical results are discussed and computational insights are presented on the basis of a seven-stage experimental network pilot study. }

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to evaluate stochastic programming models, and more specifically to compare two different approaches to asset liability management. The first uses multistage stochastic programming, while the other is a static approach based on the so-called constant rebalancing or fixed mix. Particular attention is paid to the methodology used for the comparison. The two alternatives are tested over a large number of realistic scenarios created by means of simulation. We find that due to the ability of the stochastic programming model to adapt to the information in the scenario tree, it dominates the fixed mix approach.}
