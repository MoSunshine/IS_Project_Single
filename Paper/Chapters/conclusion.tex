\section{Conclusion}

The result of this survey is a stochastic optimization framework under uncertain demand for a car-sharing provider. We see that the provider can use the model to make decisions and calculate his revenue. The network in this survey is quite small, only using four locations for pick up and drop off and seven time periods. The network is that small because of computation time and solver capability, but the computation time shows the high quality of the model and suggested that the algorithm can perform well on a big network and in real-world applications. Adding the penalty costs for unmet demand to the model makes it more realistic because canceling reservations influences customer behavior and causes costs for the service provider.\\
Future researchers can improve the model by relaxing assumptions to make it more realistic. Also, the validation of the model and testing for larger real-world data are important problems to deal with. A good point to improve the penalty cost is to formulate a risk-averse optimization model using the value-at-risk CVaR.
